DEEP Framework is a full-stack web framework for building cloud-native web applications.

> This framework is a core component of a larger ecosystem, called
[Digital Enterprise End-to-end Platform](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework/blob/master/docs/index.md).

Using DEEP Framework, developers get out-of-the-box:

- streamlined "production-like" development environment
- enterprise-level platform using microservices architecture
- virtually infinite scalability with zero devops (aka *serverless computing*)
- abstracted use of web services from cloud providers (e.g. AWS, GCP, etc.)

> [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) is the only supported cloud provider at the moment.
Help needed to add support for [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/),
[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com), and others.

Documentation is available as [Developer Guide](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework/blob/master/docs/framework.md)
and [API Guide](http://docs.deep.mg).
